# API Tests Example

This is an example Resty test file using the `.resty` extension.

## Authentication Tests

```yaml
test: get-public-endpoint
get: https://httpbin.org/get
```

```yaml
test: post-with-json-body
post: https://httpbin.org/post
content-type: application/json
body: |
  {
    "user": "test-user",
    "action": "login"
  }
success:
  # Extract the URL for use in later tests  
  request_url: $.url
```

## Data Extraction Tests

```yaml
test: extract-response-data
get: https://httpbin.org/json
success:
  # Extract values from the JSON response using JSONPath
  slideshow_title: $.slideshow.title
  author_name: $.slideshow.author
```

## Header Tests

```yaml
test: custom-headers
get: https://httpbin.org/headers
headers:
  X-Custom-Header: test-value
  User-Agent: Resty-Test-Client/1.0
```

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables in your tests:

```yaml
variables:
  base_url: $env:API_BASE_URL
  api_key: $env:API_KEY

test: authenticated-request
get: $base_url/protected
authorization: Bearer $api_key
```

This demonstrates the new `.resty` file format with full markdown syntax highlighting in VSCode!
